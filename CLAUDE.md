# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is ti8m BeachBreak, a .NET 9 application implementing a CQRS/Event Sourcing architecture for questionnaire management. The application uses a layered architecture with clear separation between Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and Frontend layers.

## Architecture

### Layered Structure
- **01_Domain**: Domain models, aggregates, events, and business logic
- **02_Application**: Commands, queries, handlers (separated into Command and Query sides)
- **03_Infrastructure**: APIs, data access, external concerns
- **04_Core**: Shared building blocks and infrastructure abstractions
- **05_Frontend**: Blazor WebAssembly frontend with Radzen UI components
- **Aspire**: .NET Aspire orchestration for local development

### Key Patterns
- **Event Sourcing**: Domain events are the source of truth, stored via Marten/PostgreSQL
- **CQRS**: Separate command and query sides with independent APIs
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Aggregates, entities, value objects, and domain events
- **Clean Architecture**: Dependencies point inward toward the domain

### Technology Stack
- .NET 9
- Blazor WebAssembly with Radzen UI
- PostgreSQL with Marten for event sourcing
- .NET Aspire for local development orchestration
- Separate Command and Query APIs

## Domain Model

### Aggregates
- **Category**: Core entity with multilingual support via Translation value object
- **Employee**: Employee management (referenced in EmployeePrompt.md)
- **Questionnaire**: Template and assignment management

## Domain Events Guidelines

### Event Characteristics
- **Past tense naming**: Use past participle forms (e.g., "Order Placed", "Payment Processed", "Customer Registered")
- **Business significance**: Focus on events that matter to domain experts and stakeholders
- **Rich semantics**: Prefer events that capture business meaning over technical CRUD operations
- **Stakeholder relevance**: Consider what different actors in the domain would care about

### Event Quality Principles
**PREFER Rich Events:**
- "Order Shipped with Express Delivery"
- "Customer Loyalty Status Upgraded"
- "Product Inventory Critically Low"
- "Payment Failed Due to Insufficient Funds"
 
**AVOID Anemic/CRUD Events:**
- "Record Created"
- "Data Updated"
- "Field Changed"
- "Status Modified"

### Value Objects
- **Translation**: Multilingual text with German and English properties

### Event Sourcing Implementation
- All aggregates inherit from `AggregateRoot` which tracks domain events
- Events are applied via reflection using the Apply pattern
- Domain events implement `IDomainEvent` interface
- Version tracking for optimistic concurrency control

## Development Commands

### Build and Run
```bash
# Build entire solution
dotnet build ti8m.BeachBreak.sln

# Run with Aspire (recommended for local development)
cd Aspire/ti8m.BeachBreak.AppHost
dotnet run

# Run individual APIs
cd 03_Infrastructure/ti8m.BeachBreak.CommandApi
dotnet run

cd 03_Infrastructure/ti8m.BeachBreak.QueryApi
dotnet run

cd 05_Frontend/ti8m.BeachBreak
dotnet run
```

### Database
- PostgreSQL database via Aspire with PgAdmin
- Event store in `events` schema
- Read models in `readmodels` schema
- Auto-migration in development mode

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Aggregates
1. Create aggregate root in `01_Domain/ti8m.BeachBreak.Domain/[AggregateName]Aggregate/`
2. Define domain events in `Events/` subfolder
3. Implement Apply methods for event sourcing
4. Add commands in `02_Application/ti8m.BeachBreak.Application.Command/Commands/[AggregateName]Commands/`
5. Add command handlers implementing `ICommandHandler<TCommand, TResult>`
6. Add queries and read models in `02_Application/ti8m.BeachBreak.Application.Query/`
7. Update repository interfaces in application layer
8. Implement repositories in `03_Infrastructure/ti8m.BeachBreak.Infrastructure.Marten/`

### Command/Query Pattern
- Commands: Modify state, return Result<T> or Result
- Queries: Read data, return DTOs/read models
- Handlers: One handler per command/query, implement respective interface
- Use CommandDispatcher/QueryDispatcher for execution

### Event Sourcing Conventions
- Events are immutable records implementing IDomainEvent
- Use past tense naming (CategoryAdded, CategoryNameChanged)
- Apply methods update aggregate state from events
- RaiseEvent() both applies event and tracks for persistence

### Frontend Integration
- Blazor Server with WebAssembly components
- Radzen UI component library
- Service discovery integration for API communication
- Separate client project for WebAssembly components

### Testing Considerations
- Event sourcing allows easy testing of business logic via events
- Use Given/When/Then pattern with domain events
- Test command handlers independently of infrastructure
- Consider read model projections in integration tests

## Critical Development Patterns (ALWAYS FOLLOW)

### 1. Controller Response Pattern
- **ALWAYS** use `CreateResponse(result)` in API controllers
- **NEVER** use direct HTTP responses like `Ok()`, `BadRequest()`, `NotFound()`, etc.
- All controllers inherit base functionality that handles response formatting consistently

### 2. Logging Pattern
- **ALWAYS** use compile-time logging with `LoggerMessageAttribute`
- **NEVER** use direct `logger.LogInformation()`, `logger.LogError()`, etc.
- Add new logging definitions to `LoggerMessageDefinitions.cs` with unique event IDs
- Follow existing event ID ranges: QuestionnaireTemplate (5001-5022), QuestionnaireAssignment (6001-6018)

### 3. File Organization Pattern
- **EVERY** class, record, interface, and enum must be in its own separate file
- **NO** multiple types per file (except for very small nested types)
- File names must match the type name exactly

### 4. DTO and Type Safety Pattern
- **NEVER** use anonymous types for API requests/responses
- **ALWAYS** create proper DTOs that match between client and server
- **FRONTEND DTOs**: Create matching DTOs in `05_Frontend/ti8m.BeachBreak.Client/Models/Dto/`
- **API DTOs**: Located in `03_Infrastructure/ti8m.BeachBreak.CommandApi/Dto/`
- **ENDPOINT MATCHING**: Ensure client calls correct endpoints:
- **TYPE SAFETY**: Replace all `object`, `var`, and anonymous types with proper strongly-typed DTOs

### 5. NEVER Use `dynamic` Keyword
- **ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN**: The `dynamic` keyword must NEVER be used in this codebase
- **ALWAYS** create strongly-typed classes or records instead
- **REASON**: Loss of compile-time type safety, IntelliSense, and refactoring support
- **EXAMPLE - BAD**:
  ```csharp
  TemplateOptions = items.Select(i => (dynamic)new { Id = i.Id, Name = i.Name }).ToList()
  ```
- **EXAMPLE - GOOD**:
  ```csharp
  // Create a proper model class
  public class QuestionnaireTemplateOption
  {
      public Guid Id { get; set; }
      public string Name { get; set; } = string.Empty;
  }

  // Use it
  TemplateOptions = items.Select(i => new QuestionnaireTemplateOption
  {
      Id = i.Id,
      Name = i.Name
  }).ToList()
  ```
