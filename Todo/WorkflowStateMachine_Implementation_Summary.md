# Workflow State Machine - Implementation Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-24
**Status**: ✅ **Phase 1 & 2 COMPLETE**
**Build Status**: ✅ **Successful** (0 errors, 1 pre-existing warning)

---

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### Phase 1: State Machine Foundation ✅ COMPLETE

#### 1. **WorkflowTransitions.cs** (Domain Layer)
**Location**: `01_Domain/ti8m.BeachBreak.Domain/QuestionnaireAssignmentAggregate/`

**Purpose**: Single source of truth for all state transitions

**Contents**:
- ✅ Forward transitions dictionary (15 transitions across 11 states)
- ✅ Backward transitions dictionary (5 reopenable states)
- ✅ Role-based authorization rules
- ✅ StateTransition and ReopenTransition records

**Key Design Decision**:
- Finalized state is NOT in backward transitions → cannot be reopened
- TeamLead can reopen submission + review states (data-scoped)
- Admin/HR can reopen ALL non-finalized states

---

#### 2. **WorkflowStateMachine.cs** (Domain Service)
**Location**: `01_Domain/ti8m.BeachBreak.Domain/QuestionnaireAssignmentAggregate/`

**Purpose**: Validates all state transitions with business rules

**Public Methods**:
```csharp
// Forward transition validation
ValidationResult CanTransitionForward(
    WorkflowState currentState,
    WorkflowState targetState,
    out string? failureReason)

// Backward transition validation (with role check)
ValidationResult CanTransitionBackward(
    WorkflowState currentState,
    WorkflowState targetState,
    string userRole,
    out string? failureReason)

// Helper methods
List<WorkflowState> GetValidNextStates(WorkflowState currentState)
List<WorkflowState> GetValidReopenStates(WorkflowState currentState)
bool IsReopenable(WorkflowState state)
string[] GetRolesWhoCanReopen(WorkflowState state)

// Auto-transition logic
WorkflowState DetermineProgressState(bool hasEmployee, bool hasManager, WorkflowState current)
WorkflowState DetermineSubmissionState(bool empSubmit, bool mgrSubmit, bool requiresReview)
```

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Role-based validation built-in
- ✅ Clear error messages
- ✅ Dictionary lookups (O(1) performance)
- ✅ Handles both simple and complex workflows
- ✅ Auto-finalization for simple workflow

---

#### 3. **WorkflowStateTransitioned Event** (Domain Event)
**Location**: `01_Domain/ti8m.BeachBreak.Domain/QuestionnaireAssignmentAggregate/Events/`

**Purpose**: Tracks forward state transitions (normal workflow progression)

```csharp
public record WorkflowStateTransitioned(
    Guid AssignmentId,
    WorkflowState FromState,
    WorkflowState ToState,
    string TransitionReason,
    DateTime TransitionedAt,
    Guid? TransitionedByEmployeeId = null) : IDomainEvent;
```

---

#### 4. **WorkflowReopened Event** (Domain Event)
**Location**: `01_Domain/ti8m.BeachBreak.Domain/QuestionnaireAssignmentAggregate/Events/`

**Purpose**: Tracks backward transitions (reopening for corrections)

```csharp
public record WorkflowReopened(
    Guid AssignmentId,
    WorkflowState FromState,
    WorkflowState ToState,
    string ReopenReason,
    DateTime ReopenedAt,
    Guid ReopenedByEmployeeId,
    string ReopenedByRole) : IDomainEvent;
```

**Key Difference from WorkflowStateTransitioned**:
- Includes `ReopenReason` (required, minimum 10 characters)
- Includes `ReopenedByRole` (for audit trail)
- Triggers email notifications (TODO)

---

#### 5. **InvalidWorkflowTransitionException** (Domain Exception)
**Location**: `01_Domain/ti8m.BeachBreak.Domain/QuestionnaireAssignmentAggregate/`

```csharp
public class InvalidWorkflowTransitionException : Exception
{
    public WorkflowState CurrentState { get; }
    public WorkflowState TargetState { get; }
    public bool IsReopenAttempt { get; }
}
```

**Used for**:
- Invalid forward transitions
- Invalid backward transitions
- Unauthorized reopening attempts

---

#### 6. **QuestionnaireAssignment Aggregate** (Updated)
**Location**: `01_Domain/ti8m.BeachBreak.Domain/QuestionnaireAssignmentAggregate/QuestionnaireAssignment.cs`

**New Public Method**:
```csharp
public void ReopenWorkflow(
    WorkflowState targetState,
    string reopenReason,
    Guid reopenedByEmployeeId,
    string reopenedByRole)
```

**Validations**:
- ✅ Cannot reopen if Finalized (IsLocked)
- ✅ Cannot reopen if Withdrawn
- ✅ Reopen reason required (minimum 10 characters)
- ✅ Role-based authorization via WorkflowStateMachine
- ✅ Raises WorkflowReopened event
- ✅ Resets submission/review flags based on target state

**New Private Methods**:
```csharp
private void TransitionWorkflowState(WorkflowState targetState, string reason, Guid? transitionedBy)
```

**Updated Methods**:
- `UpdateWorkflowState()` - Now uses `WorkflowStateMachine.DetermineProgressState()`
- `UpdateWorkflowStateOnSubmission()` - Now uses `WorkflowStateMachine.DetermineSubmissionState()`

**New Apply Methods**:
```csharp
public void Apply(WorkflowStateTransitioned @event)
public void Apply(WorkflowReopened @event)
```

---

### Phase 2: Application Layer ✅ COMPLETE

#### 7. **ReopenQuestionnaireCommand** (Command)
**Location**: `02_Application/ti8m.BeachBreak.Application.Command/Commands/QuestionnaireAssignmentCommands/`

```csharp
public record ReopenQuestionnaireCommand(
    Guid AssignmentId,
    WorkflowState TargetState,
    string ReopenReason,
    Guid ReopenedByEmployeeId,
    string ReopenedByRole) : ICommand<Result>;
```

---

#### 8. **ReopenQuestionnaireCommandHandler** (Command Handler)
**Location**: `02_Application/ti8m.BeachBreak.Application.Command/Commands/QuestionnaireAssignmentCommands/`

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Validates reopen reason (required, minimum 10 characters)
- ✅ Checks if Finalized (returns 400)
- ✅ Checks if Withdrawn (returns 400)
- ✅ **TeamLead data-scoped authorization** via `IsEmployeeInTeamAsync()`
- ✅ Calls `assignment.ReopenWorkflow()` (domain validation)
- ✅ Comprehensive logging (Info, Warning, Error levels)
- ✅ Returns appropriate HTTP status codes (400, 403, 404, 500)

**Team Authorization Algorithm**:
```csharp
private async Task<bool> IsEmployeeInTeamAsync(
    Guid teamLeadId,
    Guid employeeId,
    CancellationToken cancellationToken)
```

**How It Works**:
1. If TeamLead is reopening their own assignment → Allow
2. Load employee aggregate
3. Walk up manager hierarchy (employee → manager → manager's manager → ...)
4. Check if any manager in chain is the TeamLead
5. Prevent cycles (HashSet tracking)
6. Safety limit: Max 10 levels deep
7. Fail closed: Deny access on error

---

#### 9. **ReopenQuestionnaireDto** (API DTO)
**Location**: `03_Infrastructure/ti8m.BeachBreak.CommandApi/Dto/`

```csharp
public class ReopenQuestionnaireDto
{
    [Required]
    public WorkflowState TargetState { get; set; }

    [Required(ErrorMessage = "Reopen reason is required")]
    [MinLength(10, ErrorMessage = "Reopen reason must be at least 10 characters")]
    public string ReopenReason { get; set; } = string.Empty;
}
```

---

#### 10. **AssignmentsController** (API Endpoint)
**Location**: `03_Infrastructure/ti8m.BeachBreak.CommandApi/Controllers/AssignmentsController.cs`

**New Endpoint**:
```http
POST /c/api/v1/assignments/{assignmentId}/reopen
Authorization: Bearer {token}
Roles: TeamLead, HR, HRLead, Admin

Request Body:
{
  "targetState": "EmployeeInProgress",
  "reopenReason": "Employee needs to correct section 3 data - missing competency ratings"
}
```

**Features**:
- ✅ ModelState validation (checks Required + MinLength attributes)
- ✅ UserContext integration (gets userId from token)
- ✅ Role retrieval from authorization cache
- ✅ Maps ApplicationRole enum to string
- ✅ Uses CommandDispatcher pattern
- ✅ Returns standardized CreateResponse(result)

## 🔄 Workflow Changes

### Simple Workflow (Employee-Only)
**Before**:
```
Assigned → EmployeeInProgress → [Auto-Finalize] → Finalized
```

**After**:
```
Assigned → EmployeeInProgress → EmployeeSubmitted → Finalized
                                       ↑                  ↓
                                       ↓                  ❌ Cannot Reopen
                        🔓 Reopen by Admin/HR/TeamLead
```

**Key Change**: Added explicit `EmployeeSubmitted` state before auto-finalization

---

### Complex Workflow (With Manager Review)
**Before**: No reopening capability

**After**: Can reopen at 5 points:
```
BothSubmitted ←─────────────────🔓 Reopen (Admin/HR/TeamLead)
    ↓
InReview
    ↓
ManagerReviewConfirmed ←────────🔓 Reopen (Admin/HR/TeamLead)
    ↓
EmployeeReviewConfirmed ←───────🔓 Reopen (Admin/HR/TeamLead)
    ↓
Finalized ❌ Cannot Reopen (Terminal State)
```
